She'd take the world off my shoulders\nIf it was ever hard to move\nShe'd turn the rain to a rainbow\nWhen I was living in the blue\nWhy then, if she is so perfect\nDo I still wish that it was you?\nPerfect don't mean that it's working\nSo what can I do? (Ooh)\n\nWhen you're out of sight\nIn my mind\n'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinking of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHoping I'll find\nA glimpse of us\n\nTell me he savors your glory\nDoes he laugh the way I did?\nIs this a part of your story?\nOne that I had never lived\nMaybe one day you'll feel lonely\nAnd in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse\nMaybe you'll start slipping slowly\nAnd find me again\n\nWhen you're out of sight\nIn my mind\n\n'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinking of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHoping I'll find\nA glimpse of us\n\nOoh, ooh-ooh\nOoh, ooh-ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes\nAnd that's where I find a glimpse of us\nAnd I try to fall for her touch\nBut I'm thinking of the way it was\nSaid I'm fine and said I moved on\nI'm only here passing time in her arms\nHoping I'll find\nA glimpse of us\n
