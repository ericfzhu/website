Many Japanese never really retire—they keep doing what they love for as long as their health allows. There is, in fact, no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of “leaving the workforce for good” as in English. 

> There is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a sound mind in a sound body”): It reminds us that both mind and body are important, and that the health of one is connected to that of the other. It has been shown that maintaining an active, adaptable mind is one of the key factors in staying young.

When presented with new information, the brain creates new connections like muscle after training. An organ that is infrequently used will only wither away.

> “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.”

Each individual has their own role in life, their reason for being, which can be transformed many times over the span of their lives.

> An elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen after the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help. Instead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him what would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor, horrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she would have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see, doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for this is to survive, and mourn her.” The doctor didn’t say another word. He left Frankl’s office in peace, after taking the therapist’s hand in his own. He was able to tolerate the pain in place of his beloved wife. His life had been given a purpose.

Morita therapy — Accept your feelings and emotions. If you have obsessive thoughts, you should not try to control them to get rid of them. Simply observe them for what they are in your consciousness and let it fade away. Focus on what you should be doing in the present moment. The recovery will come on its own.

> “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.”

Instead of trying to search for beauty in perfection, true beauty lies in things that are flawed and incomplete.
