“Though we would like to live without regrets, and sometimes proudly insist that we have none, this is not really possible, if only because we are mortal.” - James Baldwin, 1967

The anti-regret philosophy is so self-evidently true that it’s more often asserted than argued. Why invite pain when we can avoid it? Why summon rain clouds when we can bathe in the sunny rays of positivity? Why rue what we did yesterday when we can dream of the limitless possibilities of tomorrow? This worldview makes intuitive sense. It seems right. It feels convincing. But it has one not insignificant flaw. It is dead wrong.

Regret is no dangerous or abnormal, a deviation from the steady path to happiness. It is healthy and universal, an integral part of being human. Regret is also valuable. It clarified. It instructs. Done right, it needn’t drag us down; it can lift us up.

Regret makes us human.
Regret makes us better.
Regret gives us hope.

Nearly all regrets fall into four core categories — foundation regrets, boldness regrets, moral regrets, and connection regrets.

Thinking is for doing. We act in order to survive. We think in order to act.

Kintsugi considers the breaks and the subsequent repairs part of the vessel’s history, fundamental elements of its being. The bowls aren’t beautiful despite the imperfections. They’re beautiful because of the imperfections. The cracks make them better.

If you have a broken heart, it means you have done something big enough and important enough and valuable enough to have broken your heart.

The consequences of actions are specific, concrete, and limited. The consequences of inaction are general, abstract, and unbounded. Inactions, by laying eggs under our skin, incubate endless speculation.

French sociologist Emile Durkheim wrote that the defining feature of religious thought (and many other belief systems is) “the division of the world into two domains, one containing all that is sacred and the other all that is profane.” We don’t always agree on the boundaries between those domains. But when we forsake what we believe is sacred for what we believe is profane, regret is the consequence.

“Happiness is love. Full stop.”

Writing about regret or revealing a regret to another person moves the experience from the realm of emotion into the realm of cognition. Instead of those unpleasant feelings fluttering around uncontrollably, language helps us capture them in our net, pin them down, and begin analysing them. By contrast, the same approach for positive experiences is less effective. For life’s happy moments, avoiding analysis and sense-making helps us maintain the wonder and delight those moments.

# Regret Optimisation Framework

Under this framework, begin by asking whether you are dealing with one of the four core regrets. If not, satisfice. If the decision does involve one of the big four, spend more time deliberating. Project yourself into the future — five years, ten years, at age eighty, whatever makes sense.
