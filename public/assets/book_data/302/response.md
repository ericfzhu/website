“Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. … The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” -Lucius Annaeus Seneca

“This is our big mistake to think we look forward toward death. Most of death is already gone. Whatever time has passed is owned by death.” -Lucius Annaeus Seneca “We are dying every day and no day, once dead, can be revived.”

A good marriage was one where a couple strove to outdo each other in devotion, where two souls stick with each other through the adversity of life and inspire each other to greater virtue.

It is not possible to live well today unless one thinks of it as his last.

Figure out how to make the most of the hand you have been dealt, play the role assigned to you with the brilliance of a character actor.

Cherish loved ones while we still have them, but accept that they belong to us only in trust, that they can depart at any moment. Because they can. And so can we.

We are all part of one large body, each with our own role, our own part to play? Even the misinformed, even the selfish, even the shameless and stupid fit in that equation, and that we shouldn’t be surprised when we meet them. Was a world of one hundred percent agreement on anything possible? Wasn’t it inevitable that some people would dissent, particularly on matters of religion? What was so shocking about the existence of the occasional heretic? What if the heretic knew you didn’t? What if most people, even the disruptive ones, were genuinely sincere in whatever they were doing?

ta eis heauton, to himself, the origin of the book Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.

Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly. You could leave right now, let that determine what you do and say and think. The curtain falls on every actor. “But I’ve only gotten three acts!” he says, giving voice to the part inside all of us that is scared to die. Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine. So make your exit with grace — the same grace shown to you.

There is no role so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now,” Marcus Aurelius would write. The role of an emperor, the role of a parent, a spouse, a person waiting in line, a person who has just been given bad news, a person who is rich, a person sent into exile or delivered into bankruptcy, a person going through a heartbreak. All of this is philosophy, all of this was what made someone a Stoic.
