A good marriage is one where a couple strives to outdo each other in devotion, where two souls stick with each other through the adversities of life and inspire each other to greater virtue.

> Cherish loved ones while we still have them, but accept that they belong to us only in trust, that they can depart at any moment. Because they can. And so can we.

> “Let us prepare our minds as if we’d come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s books each day. … The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.” -Lucius Annaeus Seneca

Learn to be tolerant with others’ mistakes and strict with yourself.

Figure out how to make the most of the hand you have been dealt, play the role assigned to you with the brilliance of a character actor.

> “Think of yourself as dead,” he writes. “You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly.” On another page he says, “You could leave life right now, let that determine what you do and say and think.” The final two entries in Meditations, which may well have been written as he lay dying, pick up the theme again. What does it matter if you live for this long or that long? he asks. The curtain falls on every actor. “But I’ve only gotten three acts!” he says, giving voice to that part inside all of us that is scared to die. Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine. So make your exit with grace—the same grace shown to you.

> “There is no role so well suited to philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now,” Marcus Aurelius would write. He probably meant the role of emperor, but the meaning can easily be extended: The role of parent. The role of spouse. The role of a person waiting in line. The role of a person who has just been given bad news. The role of a person who is rich. The role of a person sent into exile or delivered into bankruptcy. The role of a person who finds themselves enslaved, literally or otherwise. All of this was philosophy. All of this was what made someone a Stoic.
