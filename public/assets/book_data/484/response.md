# 1: The Law of Leadership
Create a category that you can be first in. It’s better to be first than it is to be better. It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first.

Not every first is going to become successful, however. Timing is an issue—your first could be too early or too late.

# 2: The Law of the Category
If you didn’t get into the prospect’s mind first, don’t give up hope. Find a new category you can be first in. 

This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented: How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better.

When you’re the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence, you have no competition.

# 3: The Law of the Mind
It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first.

The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind.

That accounts for the mystery of the well-informed opinion that can almost instantly appear in a person’s mind. One day you’ve never heard of a person.. The next day that person is famous. the “overnight sensation” is not an unusual phenomenon. If you want to make a big impression on another person, you cannot worm your way into their mind and then slowly build up a favorable opinion over a period of time. The mind doesn’t work that way. You have to blast your way into the mind.

# 4: The Law of Perception
Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perceptions.
All truth is relative. Relative to your mind or the mind of another human being. When you say, “I’m right and the next person is wrong,” all you’re really saying is that you’re a better perceiver than someone else. Most people think that they are better perceivers than others. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two.

People cling firmly to the belief that reality is the world outside of the mind and that the individual is one small speck on a global spaceship. Actually it’s the opposite. The only reality you can be sure about is in your own perceptions. If the universe exists, it exists inside your own mind and the minds of others.
There may well be oceans, rivers, cities, towns, trees, and houses out there, but there just isn’t any way for us to know these things except through our own perceptions. Marketing is a manipulation of those perceptions.

Each of us (manufacturer, distributor, dealer, prospect, customer) looks at the world through a pair of eyes. If there is objective truth out there, how would we know it? Who would measure it? Who would tell us? It could only be another person looking at the same scene through a different pair of eye-windows.
Truth is nothing more or less than one expert’s perception. And who is the expert? It’s someone who is perceived to be an expert in the mind of somebody else.

With a modicum of experience in a product category, a consumer assumes that he or she is right. A perception that exists in the mind is often interpreted as a universal truth. People are seldom, if ever wrong. At least in their own minds.

You believe what you want to believe. You taste what you want to taste. Soft-drink marketing is a battle of perceptions, not a battle of a taste.

What makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. this is the “everybody knows” principle.

# 5: The Law of Focus
The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind. A company can become incredibly successful if it can find a way to own a word in the mind of the prospect. Not a complicated word. Not an invented one. The simple words are best, words taken right out of the dictionary.

If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.

Words come in different varieties. They can be benefit related (cavity prevention), service related (home delivery), audience related (younger people), or sales related (preferred brand).

The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations. You can’t stand for something if you chase after everything.
Some companies accept the need to narrow the focus and try to accomplish this strategy in ways that are self-defeating. “We’ll focus on the quality end of the market. We won’t get into the low wend where the emphasis is on price.” The problem is that customers don’t believe you unless you restrict your business to high-priced products only, like Mercedes-Benz or BMW.

You can’t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the opposite point of view. You can’t position yourself as an honest politician, because nobody is willing to take the opposite position. You can, however, position yourself as the pro-business candidate or the pro-labor candidate and be instantly accepted as such because there is support for the other side.

# 6: The Law of Exclusivity
Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.

What often leads marketers down this booby-trapped lane is that wonderful stuff called research. Armies of researchers are employed, focus groups conducted, questionnaires tabulated—and what comes back in a three-pound report is a wish list of attributes that users want from a product or service.

What researchers never tell you is that some other company already owns the idea. They would rather encourage clients to mount massive marketing programs. the theory is that if you spend enough money, you can own the idea. Right? Wrong.

# 7: The Law of the Ladder
Your marketing strategy should depend on how soon you got into the mind and consequently which rung of the ladder you occupy. The higher the better, of course.

The mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which information to accept and which information to reject. In general, a mind accepts only new data that is consistent with its product ladder in that category. Everything else is ignored.

What about your product’s ladder in the prospect’s mind? How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product. Everyday products (cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders. Infrequent purchase products (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders. Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently. Products that are purchased infrequently and involve an unpleasant experience usually have very few rungs on their ladders. e.g. automobile batteries, tires, and life insurance, etc.

There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. you tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.

Sometimes your own ladder or category is too small. it might be better to be a small fish in a big pond than to be a big fish in a small pond.

# 8: The Law of Duality
In the long run, every market becomes a duopoly.

In the long run, marketing is a two-game race. Time frames, however, can vary. The fast-moving video game market played itself out in two or three seasons. The long-distance telephone market might take two or three decades.

Knowing that marketing is a two-horse race in the long run can help you plan strategy in the short run.
It often happens that there is no clear-cut No. 2.

# 9: The Law of the Opposite
In strength there is weakness. Wherever the leader is strong, there is an opportunity for a would-be No.2 to turn the tables.

When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two kinds of people. There are those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group.

# 10: The Law of Division
Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories.

Each segment is a separate, distinct entity. Each segment has its own reason for existence. Each segment has its own leader, which is rarely the same leader as the original category.

Many corporate leaders hold the naïve belief that categories are combining. Synergy and its kissing cousin the corporate alliance are the buzzwords in the boardrooms of America.
It won’t happen. Categories are dividing, not combining.
The way for the leader to maintain its dominance is to address each emerging category with a different brand name, as General Motors did in the early days with Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.

What keeps leaders from launching a different brand to cover a new category is the fear of what will happen to their existing brands. GM was slow to react to the super premium category that Mercedes and BMW established. One reason was that a new brand on top of Cadillac would enrage GM’s Cadillac dealers.
GM tried to take Cadillac up-market and it bombed. Why would anyone spend $54k on a Cadillac when their neighbors would probably think they only paid $30k? No prestige.

Timing is also important. You can be too early to exploit a new category. Back in the fifties the Nash Rambler was America’s first small car. But American Motors didn’t have either the courage or the money to hang in there long enough for the category to develop.
It’s better to be early than late. You can’t get into the prospect’s mind first unless you’re prepared to spend some time waiting for things to develop.

# 11: The Law of Perspective
Marketing efforts take place over an extended period of time.

Sales tend to increase business over the short run, but decrease business over the long run. This is because consumers start to understand that regular prices are too high and avoid stores that often run sales when there isn’t a sale happening.

Any sort of couponing, discounts or sales tend to educate consumers to buy only when they can get a deal.
