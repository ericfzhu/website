> I kept leveling up in school, on track, but hadn’t learned a damn thing. I was one of those kids who thought he was gaming the system when, the whole time, I’d been gaming myself.

Honesty is crucial for personal growth, so be brutally honest with yourself about any dysfunctions in your life. Don’t sugarcoat the truth or dance around the issues — if you’re overweight, admit that you’re fat and need to make a change for your health. Confront your weaknesses head on and use that raw honesty to motivate real transformation.

> Your life is not fucked up because of overt racists or hidden systemic racism. You aren’t missing out on opportunities, making shit money, and getting evicted because of America or Donald fucking Trump or because your ancestors were slaves or because some people hate immigrants or Jews or harass women or believe gay people are going to hell. If any of that shit is stopping you from excelling in life, I’ve got some news. You are stopping you!

Lacking confidence can make you vulnerable to other people’s opinions. They can only affect you as much as you take it personally.

Life experience, especially negative experiences, help callous the mind. But it’s up to you to direct that mental toughness. If you hold onto a victim mentality, it can turn into unhealthy resentment and fear of change, but if you use it to build resilience, it will make you stronger.

> The sympathetic nervous system is your fight or flight reflex. It’s bubbling just below the surface, and when you are lost, stressed out, or struggling, like I was when I was a down and out kid, that’s the part of your mind that’s driving the bus. We’ve all tasted this feeling before… What I’ve found is that you can tap into it on-call as long as you know how to manage your own mind.

Almost nothing in life will turn out exactly as we hope, and there will be moments when we feel like giving up on our goals and commitments. The 40% Rule reminds us that we have far more potential than we realise, and we can push through the discomfort and emptiness to tap into the treasure within ourselves. We must accept the hardships, insecurities, and feelings of being different or alone that are part of the journey. It’s only then that we can master our minds and achieve our full potential.

It’s easy to get caught up in meaningless activities like social media or television that drain our time and energy without providing any real benefit. Prioritise and compartmentalise important tasks into time blocks, and resist the urge to multitask.

> Starting at zero is a mindset that says my refrigerator is never full, and it never will be. We can always become stronger and more agile, mentally and physically. We can always become more capable and more reliable. Since that’s the case we should never feel that our work is done. There is always more to do.

Luck won’t always go in your favour, so you can’t get trapped in this idea that just because you’ve imagined a possibility of success means that you somehow deserve it. Don’t think about what you deserve. Aim on what you are willing to earn through hard work.

> I wasn’t meant to be this person! I had to fight myself at every turn, and my destroyed body was my biggest trophy. In that moment I knew it didn’t matter if I ever ran again, if I couldn’t operate anymore, or if I lived or died, and with that acceptance came deep appreciation. My eyes welled with tears. Not because I was afraid, but because at my lowest point I found clarity. The kid I always judged so harshly didn’t lie and cheat to hurt anyone’s feelings. He did it for acceptance. He broke the rules because he didn’t have the tools to compete and was ashamed for being dumb. He did it because he needed friends. I was afraid to tell the teachers I couldn’t read. I was terrified of the stigma associated with special education, and instead of coming down on that kid for one more second, instead of chastising my younger self, I understood him for the first time. It was a lonely journey from there to here. I missed out on so much. I didn’t have a lot of fun. Happiness wasn’t my cocktail of choice. My brain had me on constant blast. I lived in fear and doubt, terrified of being a nobody and contributing nothing. I’d judged myself constantly and I’d judged everyone else around me, too.
