> Organisations are held together by the flow of information rather than by ownership or command. Outsourcing the handling of that information to a specialist results in a lot of unnecessary data but very little useful information. Decisions are made at every level of the organisation, beginning with individual contributors and frontline supervisors.

## Effectiveness Can Be Learned

Any individual that makes significant and irreversible decisions in a company is an executive. Managers are not automatically executives. Managers of a factory line only manage people but do no affect the direction of the company In the age of knowledge work, 200 people can do a lot more than an individual. But it does not follow that they produce and contribute more than the individual.

A typical executive within an organization faces 4 major challenges:

1. Time is often taken up by the demands of others and for purposes which add very little effectiveness.

1. Difficulty in determining relevance from events that occur. The executive must decide what is important for effectiveness and not be lost to the flow of everyday work.

1. He is only successful if others within the organisation take advantage of his outputs.

1. As an organisation grows in size, the velocity of data through the organisation slows down and becomes distorted through reports. Organisations and individuals can get lost in operational work and lose sight of the true goal of a company: service to the customers.

> Truly important events in the real world are not trends, but the changes in the trends.

One has a responsibility to know what the other functions of the company are and how they operate together, as well as how internal changes affect the external environment.

## Know Thy Time

Time is the most scarcest resource. Everything and anything takes place in time and uses time. Unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed.

> The difference between time use and time waster is effectiveness and results, and thus the first step toward executive effectiveness is to record actual time use. Time use does improve with practice, but only constant efforts at managing time can prevent drifting.

One must spend a large quantum of time, usually at least 1.5 hours without distraction, to achieve focus and efficiency in a task. Spending any less is a sheer waste, both in efficiency and the context switching costs that come after. The same applies for dealing with people.

The more people that have to work together, the more time that is spent on management overhead and interpersonal relationships rather than on work and accomplishment. This can often be seen in companies with a lot of staffing bloat. Too many meetings signify that work should be in one job or in one component is spread over several jobs or components. It signifies that responsibility is diffused and that information is not addressed to the people who need it.

## What Can I Contribute?

The man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the literal sense of the phrase, “top management.” He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole. Executives who do not ask themselves, “What can I contribute?” are not only likely to aim too low, they are likely to aim at the wrong things. Above all, they may define their contribution too narrowly.

Commitment to contribution is commitment to responsible effectiveness. Without it, a man shortchanges himself, deprives his organisation, and cheats the people he works with.

## Making Strength Productive

Whoever tries to place a man or staff an organisation to avoid weakness will end up at best with mediocrity. The idea that there are well rounded people, people who have only strengths and no weaknesses is a prescription for mediocrity if not for incompetence.

> It is the duty of the executive to remove ruthlessly anyone who consistently fails to perform with high distinction. To let such a man stay on corrupts the others, and is unfair to the whole organisation.

Strength produces results, weakness only produces headaches, and the absence of weakness produces nothing.

## First Things First

> The people who get nothing done often work a great deal harder. They underestimate the time for any one task. They always expect that everything will go right, yet nothing ever goes right.

The first rule for concentration is to slough off the past that has ceased to be productive. Whether one likes it or not, they are forever bailing out the past. Today is always the result of actions and decisions taken yesterday. “If we did not already do this, would we go into it now?” If it isn’t, get rid of it so as to be able to concentrate on the few tasks that will really make a difference.

> Happiness does not come to the marriage of two people who almost got married at age 21 and who then, at age 38, both widowed, find each other again. If married at age 21, these people might have had an opportunity to grow up together. But in seventeen years both have changed, grown apart, and developed their own ways.

## The Elements of Decision making

When a problem arises, you must first decide which category it is before looking for a solution:

* Truly generic of which the individual occurrence is only a symptom

* A problem which, while a unique event for the individual institution, is actually generic

* Truly exceptional, truly unique event

* The early manifestation of a new generic problem

The specifications of the solution have to satisfy the boundary conditions. This is needed so that one knows when a decision has to be abandoned.

> It is fruitless and a waste of time to worry about what is acceptable and what one had better not say so as not to evoke resistance. One gains nothing by starting out with the question: “What is acceptable?” And in the process of answering it, one gives away the important things and loses any chance to come up with an effective, let alone with the right answer.

## Effective Decisions

A decision is a judgement. it is a choice between alternatives, and rarely is it a choice between right and wrong. It is at best a choice between “almost right” and “probably wrong”.

People inevitably start out with an opinion; to ask them to search for the facts first is even undesirable. They will simply look for the facts that fit the conclusion they have already reached.

> Averages serve the purposes of the insurance company, but they are meaningless, indeed misleading, for personnel management decisions.

If everyone is in agreement of a proposed solution, it means the solution is unlikely to work out or has yet to be fully thought through. Decisions that try to satisfy everyone satisfies no one.

The effective decision-maker either acts or he doesn’t act. He does not take half-action. This is the one thing that is always wrong, and the one sure way to not satisfy the minimum specifications, the minimum boundary conditions.
