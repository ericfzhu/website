Organisations are held together by the flow of information rather than by ownership or command. Outsourcing the handling of that information to a specialist results in a lot of unnecessary data but very little useful information.

Decisions are made at every level of the organisation, beginning with individual contributors and frontline supervisors.

Different kinds of meetings require different forms of preparation and different results:

# 1. Effectiveness Can Be Learned

A typical executive within an organization faces 4 major challenges:

There are five practices to become an effective executive:

# 2. Know Thy Time

# 3. What Can I Contribute?

# 4. Making Strength Productive

# 5. First Things First

The people who get nothing done often work a great deal harder. They underestimate the time for any one task. They always expect that everything will go right, yet nothing ever goes right.
The first rule for concentration is to slough off the past that has ceased to be productive. Whether one likes it or not, they are forever bailing out the past. Today is always the result of actions and decisions taken yesterday. “If we did not already do this, would we go into it now?” If it isn’t, get rid of it so as to be able to concentrate on the few tasks that will really make a difference in the results
The effective executive will slough off an old activity before he starts on a new one. This is necessary in order to keep organisational weight control. Without it, the organisation soon loses shape, cohesion, and manageability.
Happiness does not come to the marriage of two people who almost got married at age 21 and who then, at age 38, both widowed, find each other again. If married at age 21, these people might have had an opportunity to grow up together. But in seventeen years both have changed, grown apart, and developed their own ways.

# 6. The Elements of Decision making

# 7. Effective Decisions

A decision is a judgement. it is a choice between alternatives, and rarely is it a choice between right and wrong. It is at beast a choice between “almost right” and “probably wrong”
People inevitably start out with an opinion; to ask them to search for the facts first is even undesirable. They will simply look for the facts that fit the conclusion they have already reached.
Average serve the purposes of the insurance company, but they are meaningless, indeed misleading, for personnel management decisions.
Unless one has considered alternatives, one has a closed mind.
One does not make a decision unless there is disagreement.
The effective decision-maker either acts or he deosn’t act. He does not take half-action. This is the one thing that is always wrong, and the one sure way to not satisfy the minimum specifications, the minimum boundary conditions.
