> In contrast with proportional equality, mathematical or algebraic equality thus bears within itself a principle of non-differentiation. When applied to human beings, it signifies that there is no difference between them that could be perceived as one to relativise the aspects through which they do not differ. Understood in such a manner, equality results in the removal of anything incommensurable that actually defines the human subject in question.

The democratisation of products and culture have more often served the interests of companies than the ideals of democracy. 

Emphasis is now placed on equity rather than on equality. Instead of aspiring to equality itself, the Left seeks the maximisation of the minimum (maximin) even in economic and societal matters, meaning that it strives for a distribution or redistribution that would bestow as much as possible on those who possess the least, despite the positive effects of certain economic disparities or enforcement of law could have on incentivising people to behave differently.

> Political equality, which acts as a prerequisite for all the other ones (indeed, in democracy, it is the people that embody the constituent power), is therefore in no way abstract: it is, instead, of the highest and most substantial importance. Even among the Greeks, isonomia has never implied that citizens are equal in nature or skill, nor even that everyone is equal before the law. What it alludes to instead is the fact that every citizen has the same capacity and right to participate in public life. Democratic equality therefore implies a common belonging, thereby contributing to the definition of a given identity.

> Insofar as it emphasises the fundamental identity of individuals, of course, the Ideology of Sameness comes up against everything that, in real life, actually sets them apart. It thus finds itself compelled to explain that these differences are but secondary and fundamentally insignificant specifications. Men may well differ in appearance, but are nonetheless essentially the same. Essence and existence are thus disconnected, as are the soul and the body, spirit and matter, and even rights and duties (the former stemming from the attributes of ‘human nature’ and the latter only performed within a social relationship and in a specific context). Concrete existence is then nothing more than a deceptive embellishment, one that prevents you from perceiving the essential.

The Ideology of Sameness was initially formulated through the Christian notion that all men, regardless of their personal characteristics and of the specific context of their actual existence, are endowed with a soul as part of an equal relationship with God. That is why Christian society, no matter how diverse it may have managed to remain over the ages, revolves around a specific ideal, namely that of the Oneness of the collective body.

> The universalist ambition, which tends towards unity, always correlates with individualism, which, in turn, leads to separation and dissociation. The ideology that strives the most for the unification of the world is therefore also the very same one that triggers the greatest possible disunion. Such is the most flagrant contradiction engendered by the ideology of Sameness.

The rise of individualism, supported by liberalism, has brought about the advent of the welfare state, whose emergence the same liberalists so lament. The more community structures collapsed, the more the state had to take charge of people’s protection. The more the state guaranteed their protection, the more it exempted individuals from maintaining family-related or community-related roles that had previous been the source of said protections, creating a vicious cycle.

> The problem is that the ideology of Sameness is bound to demand the radical exclusion of all that cannot be reduced to such Sameness. Irreconcilable otherness thus becomes the primary enemy, one that must be eradicated once and for all. Such is the motivation of all totalitarian ideologies — the elimination of all those ‘redundant men’ who, owing to their very existence, impede the advent of a homogeneous society or unified world. Whosoever speaks in the name of ‘humanity’ inevitably excludes his adversaries from it.

The logical consequence is that if all men are equal, all their opinions are equally valid — hence contemporary relativism and the theory of the necessary neutrality of the state with regard to all that pertains to values and purposes. Thus, post-modernism was born.

A positive conception of Otherness consists in acknowledging differences without using them as an argument to demand that some people relinquish their existence and submit to the desires, interests or motivations of others. Not only does oppression deny the freedom of the oppressed, but also that of the oppressors themselves.

> The diversity of the world is its only true wealth, for it acts as the foundation of the most precious of assets: identity. And neither peoples nor people are actually interchangeable. To say that none bear within themselves any more or any less value than others is not tantamount to saying that they are the same (considering Sameness in its various forms), but that they are, in fact, all different. Tolerance does not consist in looking at Others so as to perceive this Sameness in them, but in doing so in order to understand what they are comprised of in terms of otherness, i.e. to grasp what otherness really is, namely a reality that cannot be reduced to any sort of ‘understanding’ through mere self-projection.

> ‘Men are afraid of Sameness, and therein lies the source of racism’, remarked Jean-Pierre Dupuy. To which he then added: ‘What men are afraid of is undifferentiation, for the latter is always a sign and product of social disintegration … Equality, whose very principle is to negate differences, gives rise to mutual dread.’ Men are indeed afraid of Sameness, at least as much, if not more, than of Otherness. In a display of irenic naiveté, dominant ideologies believe that the homogenisation of the world could only have a pacifying effect, because it allegedly enables better ‘understanding’. On the contrary, however, we can all see how it arouses identitarian tensions, awakens secular irredentism, and engenders nationalistic upheavals. At the very core of societies, furthermore, the ideology of Sameness has given birth to widespread emulative rivalry, a rivalry which René Girard described so very accurately and that exacerbates the desire to distinguish oneself from others with all the more fervour, since it actually prohibits distinctions. Sameness thus turns out to be a source of profound conflict. At its best, it results in widespread indifference and boredom; at its worst, it leads to violent reactions and inflames people’s emotions.

There are those who believe that asserting differences can only make men increasingly foreign to one another, but it is the opposite that is actually true, for every exchange presupposes otherness. An exchange only makes sense to the extent that it contributes to something in the presence of another. Exchanging the Same for the Same can only occur in monologues.

> Societies that fail to recognise differences or that regard them as insignificant are, on the other hand, doomed either to exclude those who do not fit into the unique pattern that one seeks to impose or to bring about the disintegration of social cohesion by draining it of its organic, composite and differentiated character.

The multiculturalism of today’s world is no more than the shadow of the particularisms that are now disappearing due to the increasingly homogeneous tendencies and behaviors. People already dress, eat, talk, take up residence, entertain themselves, live and even think in an increasingly similar way. They consume the same products, watch the same performances and listen to the same music. The lifestyles we have inherited from the past are only preserved for the purpose of entertainment and intended to generate added value. 

The rise in the number of micro-differences, of false pluralisms, can create an illusion of diversity while simultaneously causing us to lose sight of the deep meaning of the notion of difference. The very idea that one people or another can espouse a worldview, a way of experiencing its presence in the world in a radically different way from ours, thus gradually becomes incomprehensible.

> The Left’s diversity-preaching and progressive ideology are in perfect harmony with the individualistic liberalism advocated by the Right, since they both deny the historical and essential framework that gives specific meaning to the rights and duties of every citizen. Believing that society is based on a contract concluded by rational, free and moral individuals, or that it is shaped by automatic regulatory mechanisms stemming from the market, are two identical versions of the same liberal myth.
