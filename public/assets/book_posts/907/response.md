> My friends from high school grew up in garden-variety broken homes, and the trajectories of their lives align with data indicating that boys raised by single mothers or by caregivers other than their parents are five times more likely to be incarcerated than boys raised by both of their parents.

Foster kids are often moved into different homes, even when the situation is relatively stable, due to the availability of birth parents or relatives for care, or to prevent excessive attachment to a particular foster home.

> I was also reading a lot of books during this time, and I was drawn mostly to memoirs by people who had lived tough lives. I read Black Boy by Richard Wright, This Boy’s Life by Tobias Wolff, and Daughter of Joy, about a Chinese woman who worked as a prostitute in San Francisco during the Gold Rush. I found these books in the school library, which I’d browse alone before or after school. Whenever I felt down, it was soothing to read about others who had experienced hardship and found ways to rise above it. It seemed like whenever something good happened in my life, something bad was right around the corner. Then I’d read a few pages of a book, and I’d remember I was not alone. If, instead, I’d read stories (or scrolled images) of people living wonderful lives without any setbacks, it might have just led me to feel sorry for myself

Much of success depends not on what people do, but what they don’t do. It’s about avoiding the rash and reckless actions that will land us in trouble. The military takes in the worst, most aggressive years of a man’s life and instils discipline into them. Discipline to do what is needed regardless of personal motivation. This self-discipline is what often divides successful from unsuccessful people.

> “I failed my last class, so I have to retake it. I missed too many lectures and couldn’t catch up on the reading, but that’s okay, I’ll make it up next semester.” This was a common line. Community college creates a holding pattern, where people can take and retake classes for years with some pie-in-the-sky dream of transferring to a four-year college. Seventy percent of community college students in California never complete their programs.

> Every so often my coworkers would make these kinds of remarks, and the comments embarrassed me. My roommates would crack jokes about me being smart—poking fun about my exam scores, early promotions, the stacks of books in my bedroom. I always viewed them as jokes—I didn’t want to be thought of as smart. I didn’t see myself in that way. Some part of me rebelled against that image, because if it was true—if I was “smart”—then I might have to raise my sights for my life.

> The little kid who was betrayed over and over by parental figures and himself was suddenly seeking expression and validation. It felt like these internal conflicts had come out of nowhere. But the truth was they’d always been there, dormant, waiting until my environment was stable enough for me to process them. The stress I’d muted for years was now demanding to be heard.

> After our first session, I realised that whenever anyone said they loved me, I heard the words but never internalised them. It was the same as someone saying “good morning” to me. Just a nicety… “Look, I’m a grown man,” I said. “It feels pathetic to sit here and bitch about it. ‘Oh, this poor troubled foster kid, blah blah blah.’ But let’s be honest. My life was a shit show. My mother was strung out, my father left. All those foster homes. I was a fucking sleepover kid—let’s be honest. None of those people truly cared about me, none of them loved me.” Crickets from Alan. “I just realised something,” I said after a pause. “That means I never loved anyone during all that time either.”

## Luxury Beliefs

> I was fascinated by this new social reality and avoided discussing my life when contentious discussions erupted. I really wanted to understand what these students thought without risking them being weirded out by someone in their midst who they might have acknowledged as having had a tougher life than them, and who disagreed that words in an email could actually inflict “pain.” That was the language many students used. Danger and harm and pain. Words like trauma meant something different for them.

> I watched students claim that investment banks were emblematic of capitalist oppression, and then discovered that they’d attended recruitment sessions for Goldman Sachs. Gradually, I came to believe that many of these students were broadcasting the belief that such firms were evil in order to undercut their rivals. If they managed to convince you that a certain occupation is corrupt and thus to be avoided, then that was one less competitor they had in their quest to be hired. But they didn’t see themselves this way. They viewed themselves as morally righteous and were surprisingly myopic about the virtuous image they held of themselves.

> Many students and graduates of top universities are terrified of being seen as what they really are. We don’t leave messes for other people to clean up, it’s those other elite students from that other school. We’re not xenophobic, it’s those unenlightened people who didn’t go to a fancy college. We haven’t cultivated an ideologically rigid environment, go back to where you came from.

In the past, people displayed their status with material possession. But as luxury goods became more accessible to the middle class, the elite turned to luxury beliefs to signal their high social position and satiate their demand for status.

The elite’s drive to signal their status drives the ever-evolving standards of luxury beliefs. To stay up to date, you need to afford the kind of lifestyle that allows you keep up with the latest beliefs through books and social media. A common rebuke to those who are not up to date is “educate yourself”. This is how the affluent block mobility for people who don’t have the time or means to keep up with how to think about social issues.

> Focusing on “representation” rather than helping the downtrodden is another luxury belief. Many of the protesters on campus urged for more individuals from historically mistreated groups to be represented among students and faculty, among elite internships and occupations, and in influential positions in society at large. I thought of this as “trickle-down meritocracy.” The idea seemed to be that the best way to help struggling communities is to pluck representatives out and put them into positions of power. As long as the ruling class has a few members from these communities, then somehow the advantages they accrue will “trickle down” to their communities. Thus far, there doesn’t seem to be evidence that this works. Representation certainly benefits a handful of people who are chosen to enter elite spaces, but it doesn’t seem to improve the lives of the dispossessed. In fact, it might backfire. Elite institutions strip-mine talented people out of their communities. Upon completing their education, most of these graduates do not return to their old neighbourhoods. Instead, they relocate to a handful of cities where they live alongside their highly educated peers, eroding the bonds of solidarity they had with those they left behind. And who could blame them? It is reasonable to use your talents to advance your career and financial prospects. But if the original intent was to help languishing communities, then this particular solution is failing.

> Most personal to me is the luxury belief that family is unimportant or that children are equally likely to thrive in all family structures. In 1960, the percentage of American children living with both biological parents was identical for affluent and working-class families—95 percent. By 2005, 85 percent of affluent families were still intact, but for working-class families the figure had plummeted to 30 percent. The Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam at a 2017 Senate hearing stated, “Rich kids and poor kids now grow up in separate Americas.… Growing up with two parents is now unusual in the working class, while two-parent families are normal and becoming more common among the upper middle class.” Affluent people, particularly in the 1960s, championed sexual freedom. Loose sexual norms caught on for the rest of society. The upper class, though, still had intact families. Generally speaking, they experimented in college and then settled down later. The families of the lower classes fell apart.

Both luck and hard work influence our lives’ trajectories, but successful people tend to publicly attribute their success to luck while private emphasising hard work to loved ones. Conversely, their critics publicly ascribe the success to luck but private stress the importance of hard work. Stressing about luck can lead to disadvantaged individuals to take unnecessary risks like gambling, rather than striving to improve their circumstances through effort.

We now live in a culture where affluent, educated elites validate and affirm the behaviors of marginalised and deprived kids that they would never accept for themselves or their own children. They claim to do this in the name of compassion.

> A couple months ago, I spoke with two of Mom’s friends who asked me for advice. They view me as a responsible adult—they see someone who was honourably discharged from the military and attended top universities. This would have stunned the seventeen-year-old Rob, to learn that someday people would look at him and that is who they see. Mom’s friends were worried that their son isn’t talking as much as other six-year-olds. They, like many parents, were concerned with how “smart” their kid is. “Should we be reading to him more?” they asked me. I thought of how lonely I felt trying to teach myself how to read as a foster kid. “Yeah,” I replied. “But not because it will expand his vocabulary. Read to him because it will remind him that you love him.”
