> The truth is that grief can make you feel like you’re going crazy. Grief can make a liar out of you. You say you’re doing fine, when really your heart is shattered into a thousand tiny pieces. But everyone wants you to say you’re okay, so you do. We live in a culture that doesn’t know how to grieve. We don’t know how to experience pain, how to understand its process. We live in a society that wants us to get back to normal as soon as possible. We’re expected to go back to work immediately, keep moving, to get on with our lives. But it doesn’t work that way.

The different stages of grief have commonly been misunderstood since it was introduced. They are outlines of responses to loss that many people have, but there is not a typical response to loss as there is no typical loss. Each stage can last for just several minutes to sometimes spanning several years, and they don’t have to be experienced in linear order either.

> The first stage of grieving helps us to survive the loss. In this stage, the world becomes meaningless and overwhelming. Life makes no sense. We are in a state of shock and denial. We go numb. We wonder how we can go on, if we can go on, why we should go on… Denial helps us to pace our feelings of grief. There is a grace in denial. It is nature’s way of letting in only as much as we can handle.

> You also may experience feelings of guilt, which is anger turned inward on yourself. But you are not to blame. If you could change things, you would, but you can’t. Anger affirms that you can feel, that you did love, and that you have lost.

> Morning comes, but you don’t care. A voice in your head says it is time to get out of bed, but you have no desire to do so. You may not even have a reason. Life feels pointless. To get out of bed may as well be climbing a mountain. You feel heavy, and being upright takes something from you that you just don’t have to give. If you find a way to get through your daily activities, each of them seems as empty and pointless as the last one. Why eat? Or why stop eating? You don’t care enough to care. If you could care about what was going on, it might scare you, so you don’t want to care about anything.

When you lose a loved one, all of the roles they fulfilled are suddenly left open. Some we consciously or unconsciously take on ourselves. For others, further association with such roles becomes so incredibly painful and draining. Sometimes it’s all around you and there’s nothing you can do to get it out.

> Another loss is the old “you,” the person you were before this loss occurred, the person you will never be again. Up till now, you didn’t know this kind of sadness. You couldn’t even have imagined anything could feel this bad. Now that you are inconsolable, it feels like the new “you” is forever changed, crushed, broken, and irreparable. These temporary feelings will pass, but you will never be restored to that old person. What is left is a new you, a different you, one who will never be the same again or see the world as you once did.

You feel so alone. There is now a wall where none existed before, standing between you and the rest of the world. Interactions no longer feel the same. The one person who could bring you connection is the one person who is gone forever. And so, you feel you will be forever lost, constantly assaulted by feelings like anger, sadness and isolation. You feel like you need help.

But there is no help. There is no one that tries to understand. There is no one that can understand.

> Writing is a wonderful companion to our loneliness in a world where we stand alone. Many people write about their feelings after a loss. Some write in a grief journal to deposit their feelings without worrying about someone else’s reactions. In any case writing externalizes what is in us. Those circulatory thoughts can find an exit with the pen and paper or with the keyboard and mouse. For many, writing feels better than speaking, as the unspoken healing can come through journaling. You can find your voice in writing in a way that you can’t find in other forms of communication.

Life itself was not a problem, but the pain was. He wanted to stop the pain, he had lost hope in finding an alternative, and he decided there were no other answers to his struggles. As each possibility drops into ineffectiveness, suicide is the only remaining option.
