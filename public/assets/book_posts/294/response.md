> We’re trained for 20 years to be risk-averse. I’d like to do the experimentation, but I’d risk everything I’ve built over two decades of schooling and training by doing so. I’d need an immunity necklace. The university would never tolerate it.

An imperfect method that you can follow is infinitely better than the perfect method you quit.

> For a long time, I’ve known that the key to getting started down the path of being remarkable in anything is to simply act with the intention of being remarkable.

1. **AVOID “WHITE” CARBOHYDRATES.** Avoid any carbohydrate that is, or can be, white. The following foods are prohibited, except for within 30 minutes of finishing a resistance-training workout like those described in the “From Geek to Freak” or “Occam’s Protocol” chapters: all bread, rice (including brown), cereal, potatoes, pasta, tortillas and fried food with breading. If you avoid eating the aforementioned foods and anything else white, you’ll be safe.

1. **EAT THE SAME FEW MEALS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.** The most successful dieters, regardless of whether their goal is muscle gain or fat loss, eat the same few meals over and over again. There are 47,000 products in the average supermarket, but only a handful of them won’t make you fat.

1. **DON’T DRINK CALORIES.** Drink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened tea, coffee (with no more than two tablespoons of cream; I suggest using cinnamon instead) or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Do not drink milk (including soy milk), normal soft drinks or fruit juice. Limit diet soft drinks to no more than 450ml (16 fl oz) per day if you can, as the aspartame can stimulate weight gain.

1. **DON’T EAT FRUIT.** The only exceptions to the no-fruit rule are tomatoes and avocados, and the latter should be eaten in moderation. Otherwise, just say no to fruit and its principal sugar, fructose, which is converted to glycerol phosphate more efficiently than almost all other carbohydrates. Glycerol phosphate → triglycerides (via the liver) → fat storage. There are a few biochemical exceptions to this, but avoiding fruit six days per week is the most reliable policy.

1. **TAKE ONE DAY OFF PER WEEK.** I recommend Saturdays as your Dieters Gone Wild (DGW) day. Paradoxically, dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function and conversion of T4 to T3, etc.) doesn’t downshift from extended caloric restriction.

The goal is to have as much of the ingested food either go into muscle tissue or out of the body unabsorbed. Ensure that the first meal of the day is high in protein and low in total calories. During the weekly binge, use air squats or wall presses to increase muscle contraction.

* **Policosanol**: 20–25 mg, consume before bed

* **Alpha-lipoic acid**: 100–300 mg, consume before all meals and bed

* **Green tea flavanols**: 325mg, consume before all meals and bed

* **Garlic extract**: at least 200 mg, consume before all meals and bed

Orgasm is when there is no longer any physical or emotional resistance between one finger and the clitoris. This state naturally leads to the involuntary contractions and flushing that most associate with the word orgasm.

> “No man can give you an orgasm. He can only help you do it yourself.” This is why I used the word facilitate earlier. First and foremost, Nina emphasized, a woman has to be comfortable masturbating. “If she doesn’t masturbate regularly, she’ll be more trouble, baggage-wise, than it’s worth, unless you get off on being the fixer. She has to at least come up to the starting line and be comfortable conversing with her own orgasmic potential.” For years, Nina herself was too embarrassed to show her “O face”—her face during orgasm—to partners, thinking it was ugly or unattractive, not realizing that men go nuts for it. “The woman needs to know how beautiful and exciting she is in that state.”
