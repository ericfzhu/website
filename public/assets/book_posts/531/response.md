> “Though we would like to live without regrets, and sometimes proudly insist that we have none, this is not really possible, if only because we are mortal.” - James Baldwin

People often like to reject the idea of having regrets as it only invites pain and sorrow. It is wrong. Regret makes us human. Regret makes us better. Regret gives us hope.

> Regret is the quintessential upward counterfactual — the ultimate *if only*. The source of its power, scientists are discovering, is that it muddles the conventional pain-pleasure calculus. Its very purpose is to make us feel worse — because by making us feel worse today, regret helps us do better tomorrow.

Nearly all regrets fall into four core categories:

* **Foundation regrets:** education, finance, health regrets fall under our failure to be responsible, conscientious, or prudent

* **Boldness regrets:** more likely to regret the chances that we didn’t take than the chances we did

* **Moral regrets:** acting immoral, sometimes after rationalising that action

* **Connection regrets:** our actions give our lives direction, other people give those lives purpose. Fractured or unrealised relationships with spouses, partners, parents, children, siblings, friends, classmates, and colleagues.

> If you have a broken heart, it means you have done something big enough and important enough and valuable enough to have broken your heart.

If you ever find yourself consumed by negativity, it may help by writing about it or revealing it to another person. By externalising and giving shape to the seemingly uncontrollable emotions, you can begin to distance yourself from them, to heal from the hurt that it has created.
