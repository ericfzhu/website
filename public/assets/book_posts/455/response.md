Over the years, one criticism of Tesla has been that the company was “bailed out” or “subsidized” by the government in 2009. Tesla did not get any money from the Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which provided GM and Chrysler with $18.4B in loans. Tesla did get $465 million in June 2009 in interest bearing loans from Department of Energy.

Musk proposed to Talulah Riley weeks after they met in the summer of 2008, but they both agreed they should wait about two years before they actually got married.

There was one problem, Straubel recalls. “We had no clue how to build a battery factory.” Panasonic’s top leaders were hesitant. They never had that type of partnership, and Musk did not strike them as an easy guy to dance with.
To prod Panasonic, Musk and Straubel came up with a charade. At a site near Reno, Nevada, they set up lights and sent in bulldozers to start preparing for construction. Then Straubel invited his counterpart at Panasonic to join him on a viewing platform to watch the work. The message was clear: Tesla was forging ahead with the factory. Did Panasonic want to be left behind?

It was inevitable that there would be some fatal accidents involving Autopilot, just as there were without Autopilot. It was a logical stance, but it ignored the emotional reality that a person killed by an Autopilot system would provoke a lot more horror than a hundred deaths caused by driver error.

“Because I’m just a fool for love,” Elon says. “I am often a fool, but especially for love.”

Musk calculated that on a good day he made a hundred command decisions as he walked the floor. “At least twenty percent are going to be wrong, and we’re going to alter them later,” he said. “But if I don’t make decisions, we die.”

The fuel for AI is data. The new chatbots were being trained on massive amounts of information, such as billions of pages on the internet and other documents. Google and Microsoft had their search engines and cloud services respectively.
One asset Musk had was the Twitter feed, which included more than a trillion tweets posted over the years, five hundred million added each day. The value of this data feed was not something Musk considered when buying Twitter. “It was a side benefit, actually, that I realised only after the purchase.”
