> Over the years, one criticism of Tesla has been that the company was “bailed out” or “subsidized” by the government in 2009. Tesla did not get any money from the Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which provided GM and Chrysler with $18.4B in loans. Tesla did get $465 million in June 2009 in interest bearing loans from Department of Energy.

> There was one problem, Straubel recalls. “We had no clue how to build a battery factory.” Panasonic’s top leaders were hesitant. They never had that type of partnership, and Musk did not strike them as an easy guy to dance with. To prod Panasonic, Musk and Straubel came up with a charade. At a site near Reno, Nevada, they set up lights and sent in bulldozers to start preparing for construction. Then Straubel invited his counterpart at Panasonic to join him on a viewing platform to watch the work. The message was clear: Tesla was forging ahead with the factory. Did Panasonic want to be left behind?

It was inevitable that there would be fatal accidents involving FSD, just as there were without FSD. It was a logical stance, but it ignored the emotional reality that a person killed by an Autopilot system would provoke a lot more horror than a hundred deaths caused by driver error. The phenomenon can be explained by the illusion of control, where individuals feel a direct sense of command over their safety when actively behind the wheel. In contrast, they must relinquish control to the vehicle’s automated systems, leading to a heightened sense of vulnerability, despite lower actual risk.

> Musk calculated that on a good day he made a hundred command decisions as he walked the floor. “At least twenty percent are going to be wrong, and we’re going to alter them later,” he said. “But if I don’t make decisions, we die.”

## The Algorithm

1. **Question every requirement.** Each should come with the name of the person who made it, and not the name of a department. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them.

1. **Delete any part or process you can.** You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn’t delete enough.

1. **Simplify and optimise.** This should come after step two. A common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.

1. **Accelerate cycle time.** Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realised should have been deleted.

1. **Automate.** That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.
