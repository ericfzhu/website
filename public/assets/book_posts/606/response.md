> The way we dress reflects not only our personality but also our economic, political, and social standing and our self-worth.

The barriers to luxury came crashing down with the civil rights movement and social upheaval of the 1960s. Not only did blacks have the right to enter establishments once reserved solely for whites, the middle class could emulate the wealthy, including patronising their finest addresses, without fear of admonishment or ridicule. America’s dream of a capitalist democracy was finally fully realised: nothing was off limits to anyone anymore.

Luxury used to be an intimate, elegant business for an elite clientele. Shopping for clothes, be it couture or ready-to-wear, was a pleasurable affair. You chose what you liked, often during a fashion show or a personal viewing, retired to a spacious, comfortable dressing room, tried on the garments leisurely, and had the seamstress on hand to do whatever retouching was necessary. Today, by contrast, there are only a few pieces of clothing in stock and only in the smallest sizes. This is where the slim sales assistants come in: they scurry into the back storeroom for 10, 20 minutes to find your size, or perhaps another style that isn’t on the floor, or even a dress that no one else has seen. This, in the minds of luxury executives, is attentive, specialised service.

High end couture work is now produced in a very limited quantity by high skilled craftsmen in France, Italy and the UK. The middle range, such as the ready-to-wear, is farmed out to factories in places like Spain, Turkey, North Africa, and other Eastern Europe countries. The lowest end of the luxury spectrum, like the logo-covered luxury T-shirts and knitwear, are produced in developing nations like China, Mexico, Madagascar, and Mauritius.

> “I’m no philosopher, but it seems to me that women—and men too—instinctively yearn to exhibit themselves. In this machine age, which esteems convention and uniformity, fashion is the ultimate refuge of the human, the personal and the inimitable. Even the most outrageous innovations should be welcomed, if only because they shield us against the shabby and the humdrum. Of course fashion is a transient, egotistical indulgence, yet in an era as somber as ours, luxury must be defended centimeter by centimeter.” — Christian Dior

Today, luxury branded status items are collected like baseball cards and displayed like artwork. The idea of luxury has shifted from what the product is to what it represents. By wearing or carrying an item emblazoned with a logo, you declare that you are a member of that particular brand’s message and dreams. By putting an emphasis on the logo and spending more than $100 million a year to advertise it, luxury companies made their brands, rather than the actual products, the objects of public desire.

> As Miuccia tells it, she has always struggled to accept what she does for a living. “It’s a very big conflict,” she explained. “I am tempted to say what is luxury: servants and sixteenth-century service. If you want to talk about rare beauty, I know what that is. To fake luxury today is easy. You put some details from the brand’s past, you put a little bit of gold, and that’s it. I can’t bear that … Real luxurious people hate status. You don’t look rich because you have a rich dress. When you look at a person, do you see the spirit or the sexiness or the creativity? Just to see a big diamond, what does it mean? It’s all about satisfaction. I think it’s horrible, this judgment based on money. It’s all an illusion that you look better because you have a symbol of luxury. Really, it doesn’t bring you anything. It’s so banal.”

When luxury companies were run by their owners or heirs, each house had its own distinctive style that reflected the founder’s creative vision, right down to the boutique. Now it has given way to homogenisation, to the rise in micro-differences, to an illusion of diversity between brands. The modern designers all know each other, and many move freely from one company to another along with their support staffs, all consuming from the same culture, eating the same food, living the same lifestyles.

> “Contentment is natural wealth. Luxury is artificial poverty.” — Socrates

> “Luxury is the ease of a T-shirt in a very expensive dress. If you don’t have it, you are not a person used to luxury. You are just a rich person who can buy stuff.” — Karl Lagerfeld

Handbags and other small leather goods have joined perfume as “entry level products” to a luxury brand. Unlike perfume, handbags give the wearer the chance to brandish the logo and publicly declare her aspirations. Despite often costing as much as the ready-to-wear pieces, people found handbags much easier to justify as they can be worn daily, to be matched with any outfit. The modern handbag symbolised a new era of independence for women, of being able to leave home without answering to anyone.

> “It’s like McDonald’s: the merchandise and philosophy behind it is very similar. You get the same hamburger and the same experience in every McDonald’s. Same with Vuitton. We helped create that at Gucci. It was the right thing at that time. Had we not done it, someone else would have it. The world was becoming a global culture. — Tom Ford

Unfortunately, the luxury brands have also created a demand they couldn’t meet, and a product that average consumers craved but couldn’t always afford. How many secretaries, teachers, or sales executives could really buy a new $500 Prada or $700 Louis Vuitton handbag every season? Counterfeiters stepped in with copies at 5 to 10% of the retail price, and the new hungry middle class started buying and buying. Fuelled by the rising middle class in many developing economies, luxury brands now lose roughly $10 billion dollars annually to counterfeit products.

> “Most Chinese buy luxury as a status symbol rather than taste. They like logos. They want people to know they are carrying something expensive. You see people walk into stores and say, ‘Where is this brand from? Italy? Must be good!’ They can’t pronounce the names and they don’t know where it comes from. They just want it because it’s expensive.”
