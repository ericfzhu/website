> Clara said her old connections made her a high-value coin, a coin that Julia now must spend. She reminded Julia of her maiden name, a name she shared with a colonel who’d fought on the wrong side in the revolution. She now told Julia for the first time that this colonel was Clara’s brother.

She listed the old revolutionaries she’d known who had since been shot as traitors. ‘It is they who gave me my orders. They planned this famine, and I helped execute it. You must remember that.’ She told Julia how to behave, the emotions she must feign, and Julia was too stunned to argue.

Never mind espionage; even to get a job as a dock worker was beyond his powers. He was an office clerk who cowered from rats. He couldn’t even buy his own black-market goods!
