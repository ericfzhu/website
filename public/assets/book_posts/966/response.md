How can law and punishment exist in a world without free will? How will responsibility operate as a framework when no one is capable of being responsible over their own actions? Obviously, certain criminals must still be incarcerated, solely for the benefit of everyone else being better off.

However, if we consider the broader implications of a world without free will, it becomes clear that even the most terrifying predators are just unlucky to be who they are, and the logic of hating them begins to unravel. This, of course, is based on the assumption that humans are logical.

While this frameworks makes sense in the abstract, the current legal system and societal structure seem to be shaped by human emotions as much as logic. The desire for punishment and retribution often stems from the emotional response of those who have been harmed, rather than a rational assessment of the offender’s lack of control over their actions. The same structures also play an important role in shaping an individual’s environment and incentives, ultimately guiding them towards choices that benefit society as whole.

> Both determinism and libertarianism hold that if our behavior is fully determined by background causes, free will is an illusion. Determinists believe that we live in such a world, while libertarians imagine that human agency must magically rise above the plane of physical causation. Libertarians sometimes invoke a metaphysical entity, such as a soul, as the vehicle for our freely acting wills. Compatibilists, however, claim that determinists and libertarians are both confused and that free will is compatible with the truth of determinism.

> Compatibilists like Daniel Dennett insist that even if our thoughts and actions are the product of unconscious causes, they are still our thoughts and actions. Anything that our brains do or decide, whether consciously or not, is something that we have done or decided. The fact that we cannot always be subjectively aware of the causes of our actions does not negate free will—because our unconscious neurophysiology is just as much “us” as our conscious thoughts are.

It is true that many people feel identical to a certain channel of information in their conscious minds. Dennett is simply asserting that we are more than this—we are coterminous with everything that goes on inside our bodies, whether we are conscious of it or not. This, I believe, is similar to believing that you are in control of your body’s health and wellbeing, despite it not directly controllably via consciousness.

> Many people believe that human freedom consists in our ability to do what, upon reflection, we believe we should do—which often means overcoming our short-term desires and following our long-term goals or better judgment. This is certainly an ability that people possess, to a greater or lesser degree, and which other animals appear to lack, but it is nevertheless a capacity of our minds that has unconscious roots. You have not built your mind. And in moments in which you seem to build it—when you make an effort to change yourself, to acquire knowledge, or to perfect a skill—the only tools at your disposal are those that you have inherited from moments past. Choices, efforts, intentions, and reasoning influence our behavior—but they are themselves part of a chain of causes that precede conscious awareness and over which we exert no ultimate control. My choices matter—and there are paths toward making wiser ones—but I cannot choose what I choose. And if it ever appears that I do—for instance, after going back and forth between two options—I do not choose to choose what I choose. There is a regress here that always ends in darkness. I must take a first step, or a last one, for reasons that are bound to remain inscrutable.

A wide variety of human behaviors can be modified by punishments and incentives—and attributing responsibility to people in these contexts is quite natural. It may even be unavoidable as a matter of convention. 

> Consider the biography of any “self-made” man, and you will find that his success was entirely dependent on background conditions that he did not make and of which he was merely the beneficiary. There is not a person on earth who chose his genome, or the country of his birth, or the political and economic conditions that prevailed at moments crucial to his progress. And yet, living in America, one gets the distinct sense that if certain conservatives were asked why they weren’t born with club feet or orphaned before the age of five, they would not hesitate to take credit for these accomplishments.

Every individual is the current end of a long line of ancestors who survived long enough to reproduce, to will their current evolutions into existence. It is through the survival of the fittest that resulted in how each person is the way they are today.
