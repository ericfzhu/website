Never invest in any idea you can’t illustrate with a crayon. (Or easily explain to an uneducated individual on the pros and cons)



You can’t see the future through a rear view mirror



The extravagance of any corporate office is directly proportional to management’s reluctance to reward the shareholders



Pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds



If you’re prepared to invest in a company, then you ought to be able to explain why in simple language that a fifth grader could understand, and quickly enough so the fifth grader won’t get bored



The out of touch expert if part of a growing crowd on Wall St. Analysts spend more and more time selling and defending ideas to their superiors and/or clients, and less and less researching the ideas. 



In stocks as in romance, ease of divorce is not a sound basis for commitment. If you’ve chosen wisely to begin with, you won’t want a divorce. And if you haven’t, you’re in a mess no matter what. All the liquidity in the world isn’t going to save you from pain, suffering, and probably a loss of money.



A sure cure for taking a stock for granted is a big drop in the price.



Shareholders play a major role in a fund’s success or failure. If they are steadfast and refuse to panic in the scary situations, the fund manager won’t have to liquidate stocks at unfavorable prices in order to pay them back.



There’s no shame in losing money on a stock. What is shameful is to hold on to a stock, or, worse, to buy more of it when the fundamentals are deteriorating.



Before you invest in a low-priced stock in a shaky company, look at what’s been happening to the price of the bonds.



No matter what price you pay for a stock, when it goes to zero you’ve lost 100 percent of your money



Stockpicking is both an art and a science. 



It’s human nature to avoid looking at stocks you’ve once owned, especially one that’s gone up since you sold it. People have to train themselves to overcome this phobia. Think of investments not as disconnected events, but as continuing sagas, which need to be rechecked from time to time for new twists and turns in the plots. Unless a company goes bankrupt, the story is never over.



If you like the store, changes are you’ll love the stock.



In business, competition is never as healthy as total domination.



A healthy portfolio requires a regular checkup—perhaps every six months or so. The six month checkup consists of answering two basic questions: 1) is the stock still attractively priced relative to earnings, and 2) what is happening in the company to make the earnings go up?



When the best company in an industry is selling at a bargain price, it often pays to buy that one, as opposed to investing in a lesser competitor that may be selling at a lower price.
