Stock-picking is both an art and a science. 

Never invest in any idea that you cannot easily explain the costs and benefits to an uneducated individual.

You can’t see the future if you only look at the rear view mirror.

> The extravagance of any corporate office is directly proportional to management’s reluctance to reward the shareholders.

If you like the store, changes are you’ll love the stock.

Ease of divorce is not a sound basis for commitment. If you’ve chosen wisely, you won’t want a divorce, and if you haven’t, you’ll be in for a world of pain and suffering no matter what.

If shareholders are steadfast and refuse to panic in economic downturns, the fund manager won’t have to liquidate stocks at unfavourable prices.

> There’s no shame in losing money on a stock. What is shameful is to hold on to a stock, or, worse, to buy more of it when the fundamentals are deteriorating.

Bonds usually tell a more complete story of a company’s health, especially when the company is in financial distress.

> It’s human nature to avoid looking at stocks you’ve once owned, especially one that’s gone up since you sold it. People have to train themselves to overcome this phobia. Think of investments not as disconnected events, but as continuing sagas, which need to be rechecked from time to time for new twists and turns in the plots. Unless a company goes bankrupt, the story is never over.

> A healthy portfolio requires a regular checkup—perhaps every six months or so. The six month checkup consists of answering two basic questions: 1) is the stock still attractively priced relative to earnings, and 2) what is happening in the company to make the earnings go up?
