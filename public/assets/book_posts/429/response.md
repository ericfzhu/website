> “History never repeats itself; man always does.” - Voltaire

Financial modelling and research can calculate to a decent degree the probabilities of outcomes. But they can’t ever get rid of the feeling of worry, of wondering if you’ve made a mistake that will impact the lives of your loved ones.

> When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when judging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too demoralising to accept.

When things are going well, attributing too much of the success to skill can be fatal. This is also true in the opposite direction, when it could just the consequences of risk. The trick to dealing with risk is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and there won’t wipe you out. Try to find humility when things are going right and compassion when they go wrong.

When people have $1-2m they think their number is 5. When they have 5 they think their number is 15. It turns out that the thing that well-off people are most lacking is having enough.

> To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.

The ceiling of social comparison with the advent of social media is so high that no one will hit it. It’s a battle that you can never win by competing in it, only by not participating to begin with—to accept that you have enough, even if it’s less than those around you. 

> Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough.

In most life scenarios, the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan. However, very rarely you just need to throw away everything else and commit. The more you need specific elements of a plan to be true, the more fragile your life becomes.

> People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.

One of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.

> It comes from investor John Templeton’s view that “The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” Templeton, though, admitted that it is different at least 20% of the time. The world changes. Of course it does. And those changes are what matter most over time. Michael Batnick put it: “The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, ‘The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’”

Everything that can break will eventually break. If too many things rely on one thing working, you are counting the days to catastrophe. The single biggest point of failure that many people have is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, or living paycheck-to-paycheck.

> It sounds trivial, but thinking of market volatility as a fee rather than a fine is an important part of developing the kind of mindset that lets you stick around long enough for investing gains to work in your favor. Few investors have the disposition to say, “I’m actually fine if I lose 20% of my money.” This is doubly true for new investors who have never experienced a 20% decline. But if you view volatility as a fee, things look different. Disneyland tickets cost $100. But you get an awesome day with your kids you’ll never forget. Last year more than 18 million people thought that fee was worth paying.

It is irrational to believe that assets can have one rational price in a world where investors have different time horizons. It’s hard to grasp that other investors have different goals than we do, because an anchor of psychology is not realising that rational people can see the world through a different lens than your own. Realise the game that you are playing and the games that others are.

> Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism. Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.

People are more likely to believe stories that confirm or overestimate their prior beliefs.

> It’s hard for a policymaker to predict an outright recession, because a recession will make their careers complicated. So even worst-case projections rarely expect anything worse than just “slow-ish” growth. It’s an appealing fiction, and it’s easy to believe because expecting anything worse is too painful to consider. Policymakers are easy targets for criticism, but all of us do this to some extent. And we do it in both directions. If you think a recession is coming and you cash out your stocks in anticipation, your view of the economy is suddenly going to be warped by what you want to happen. Every blip, every anecdote, will look like a sign that doom has arrived—maybe not because it has, but because you want it to.

Never trust hindsight. It only gives the illusion that the world is understandable, that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense.
