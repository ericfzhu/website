> When asked why we do the things we do, we rarely say, ‘It’s because of status. I really love it.’ It can be distasteful to think of it as any kind of motivating force, let alone a vital one. It contradicts the heroic story we like to tell of ourselves. When we pursue the great goals of our lives, we tend to focus on our happy ending.

Losing these connections can be profoundly damaging, as isolation can change who we are and make the world feel hostile.

> In the luxury attire game, the general rule is the larger the logo, the lower the status and therefore price. One analysis found ‘an increase in logo size of one point on a seven-point scale translates to a $122.26 price decrease for Gucci handbags and a $26.27 price decrease for Louis Vuitton handbags’. The logo on Bottega Veneta’s $2,500 Hobo bag isn’t visible. They put it on the inside.

The innate drive for relative advantage starts early in life. Children are sensitive to inequality and often prefer having more than others, even if it means sacrificing fairness or absolute gain. This pursuit of status is never stops, and we can often find ourselves playing hyper-local status games that are transient and limited to just two people.
