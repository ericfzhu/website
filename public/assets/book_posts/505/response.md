> “The object isn’t to make art, it’s to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.” — Robert Henri

To create is to bring something into existence that wasn’t there before. It doesn’t have to be witnessed, recorded, or sold for it to be a work of art.

> To live as an artist is a way of being in the world. A way of perceiving. A practice of paying attention. Refining our sensitivity to tune in to the more subtle notes. Looking for what draws us in and what pushes us away. Noticing what feeling tones arise and where they lead.

If you aren’t attuned to these feelings, you’re likely to lose the signal in the noise. Don’t try to analyse your way into these feelings, but rather create spaces were these feelings can naturally flourish.

> Making art is a serious matter. Harnessing creative energy from Source. Shepherding ideas into the physical plane. Participating in the cosmic cycle of creation. The opposite is also true. Making art is pure play. Within every artist, there’s a child emptying a box of crayons onto the floor, searching for just the right color to draw the sky. It might be violet, olive, or burnt orange. As artists, we strive to preserve this playfulness throughout the gravity of the enterprise. We embrace both the seriousness of the commitment and the playfulness of being completely free in the making.

The beginner’s mind is starting from a place of not knowing, and living in the moment with as few fixed beliefs as possible.

> The act of creation is an attempt to enter a mysterious realm. A longing to transcend. What we create allows us to share glimpses of an inner landscape, one that is beyond our understanding. Art is our portal to the unseen world.

To be an artist is to have a hunger to see beautiful things, hear beautiful sounds, and feel deeper sensations. It’s to learn and to be fascinated on a continual basis. The work is not about perfection. All art is a work in progress, a point in time, a new beginning for the artist. It is a process that never ends. They are different snapshots of who we are, and who we were. They were all our best work in the moment they were created.

Humans are far from flawless, and it is those imperfections that attracts us to art, to beauty.

If you’re immediately turned off by an experience of something new, it’s worth examining why. Powerful reactions often indicate deeper wells of meaning.

> If you’ve truly created an innovative work, it’s likely to alienate as many people as it attracts. The best art divides the audience. If everyone likes it, you probably haven’t gone far enough. **In the end, you are the only one who has to love it. This work is for you.**

> It’s not uncommon to long for outward success, hopeful it will fill a void inside ourselves. Some imagine achievement as a remedy to fix or heal a sense of not being enough. Artists who work diligently to accomplish this are rarely prepared for the reality of it. Most aspects of popularity are not as advertised. And the artist is often just as empty as they were before, probably more so. If you are living in the belief that success will cure your pain, when the treatment comes and doesn’t work, it can lead to hopelessness. A depression can accompany the realisation that what you’ve spent most of your life chasing hasn’t fixed your insecurities and vulnerabilities. More likely, with the stakes and consequences now higher, it has only amplified the pressure. And we are never taught how to handle this epic disappointment.
