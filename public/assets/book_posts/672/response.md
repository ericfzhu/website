Fortunately, advancements in GMO and farming methods have solved this problem since The Population Bomb was published in 1968.

> Each year food production in these countries falls a bit further behind burgeoning population growth, and people go to bed a little bit hungrier... Of these poor, a minimum of ten million people, most of them children, will starve to death during each year of the 1970s. But this is a mere handful compared to the numbers that will be starving before the end of the century. And it is now too late to take action to save many of those people.

> Babies had bigger and bigger heads. There were limits to how large a woman's pelvis could conveniently become. To make a long story short, the strategy of evolution was not to make a woman bell-shaped and relatively immobile, but to accept the problem of having babies who were helpless for a long period while their brains grew after birth. How could the mother defend and care for her infant during its unusually long period of helplessness? She couldn't, unless Papa hung around. The girls are still working on that problem, but an essential step was to get rid of the short, well-defined breeding season characteristic of most mammals. The year-round sexuality of the human female, the long period of infant dependence on the female, the evolution of the family group, all are at the roots of our present problem. They are essential ingredients in the vast social phenomenon that we call sex. Sex is not simply an act leading to the production of offspring. It is a varied and complex cultural phenomenon penetrating into all aspects of our lives—one involving our self-esteem, our choice of friends, cars, and leaders.

Billions of years of evolution have given us humans a powerful will to live and reproduce. Despite this, we have somehow managed to conquer our natural desires using birth control, and likely not for the better.

> The present growth of the world population commits us irrevocably to a policy of increasing annual food production for at least the next two or three generations. If this is to be successful, we must learn to do it in the most efficient, least damaging way. If we want the most food produced per acre, we must for the most part eat the plants. The reason is quite simple: the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The law says, in part, that when energy is transferred, some of it becomes unusable at each transfer. Each time energy is transferred in an ecosystem, some of it is converted into heat energy which is not usable by the organisms in the system.

Technological advancements in energy capacity and efficiency have allowed for the production of less efficient foods. Food itself is a solved problem, the only major problem we face today is the problem of distribution.

> A ship has hit the rocks and is sinking. The passengers scream for help. Some jump overboard and are devoured by the circling sharks. A group of distinguished scientists is on board. One of their number suggests that they can help man the pumps. "Oh, no!" shout the others. "That might hurt the captain's feelings. Besides, pumping is not our business. It's outside our field of competence." You can guess what they do. They appoint a committee to study the problem, with subcommittees on marine engineering and navigation. They announce to the passengers that in two or three years the committee will produce a wonderful report which will be acceptable to the passengers, the captain, and the steamship line. Not so passive are the politicians. Some jump up to say that the passengers don't understand the political realities of the situation. Other more progressive politicians grab thimbles and start bailing, stopping every few seconds to accept praise for their valiant efforts

> Obviously our first step must be immediately to establish and advertise drastic policies designed to bring our own population size under control… The second step is very important, as we also are going to have to adopt some very unpopular foreign policy positions relative to population control, and we must do it from a psychologically strong position.

Population control has been one of the biggest errors of the current century, as can be seen by the negative replacement rates in Asian countries and China’s one child policy. Societies have become more hedonistic with the breakdown of the family structure and traditional religious values.

> These problems include finding substitutes for the satisfaction and rewards that women derive from childbearing and for the ego satisfaction that often accompanies excessive fatherhood. Implicit attitudes and social pressures within our society toward parenthood, especially motherhood, add up to an even more powerful pro-natal policy than our legal system represents. Equal opportunities and salaries for women in business and the professions, which are now being sought by the women's liberation movement, would strongly encourage them to seek other outlets for their energy and talents besides motherhood. Society would greatly benefit both from the resulting lowered fertility and the productive contributions of the women.
