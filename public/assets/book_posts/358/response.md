> ‘Compared to what we ought to be,’ said the famous Professor William James of Harvard, ‘compared to what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.’

Criticism only serves to put an individual on the defensive. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person’s pride, and they focus on justifying themselves instead of the issue at hand. Remember that humans are not rational nor logical. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

> Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

> There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.

Find a way to align the incentives of people you want to work and you won’t even have to ask them to work. Talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

This is not the same as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation.

> Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else. Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks of himself.

> If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.
