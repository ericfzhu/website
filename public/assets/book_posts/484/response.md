## Leadership

It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to convince someone that you have the better product. Your product has to be at least a magnitude better than the competitor for users to want to switch.

## Category

Think in categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands, but are open when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better.

## Mind

Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first.

## Perception

All truth is relative. Relative to your mind or the mind of another human being. When you say, “I’m right and the next person is wrong,” all you’re really saying is that you’re a better perceiver than someone else. Most people think that they are better perceivers than others. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two.

## Focus

A company can become incredibly successful if it can find a way to own a word in the mind of the prospect. Not a complicated word. Not an invented one. The simple words are best, words taken right out of the dictionary.

You can’t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the opposite point of view. You can’t position yourself as an honest politician, because nobody is willing to take the opposite position.

##  Exclusivity

Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind. This is often the mistake companies make when they conduct focus groups, surveys, and the like. They think that spending enough money in marketing will allow you to own the word. That is only up to the other company to forfeit.

## Ladder

The mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which information to accept and which information to reject.

What about your product’s ladder in the prospect’s mind? How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product. Everyday products (cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders. Infrequent purchase products (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders. Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently. Products that are purchased infrequently and involve an unpleasant experience usually have very few rungs on their ladders (automobile batteries, tires, and life insurance).

You tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.

## Duality

In the long run, marketing is a two-game race. Time frames, however, can vary. Knowing that marketing is a two-horse race in the long run can help you plan strategy in the short run.

## Opposite

In strength there is weakness. Wherever the leader is strong, there is an opportunity for a would-be #2 to turn the tables. There are always individuals who refuse to buy from the leader of a product category.

## Division

Many corporate leaders hold the naïve belief that categories are combining. Synergy and its kissing cousin the corporate alliance are the buzzwords in the boardrooms of America. It won’t happen. Categories are dividing, not combining.

The way for the leader to maintain its dominance is to address each emerging category with a different brand name, as General Motors did in the early days with Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.

## Perspective

Marketing efforts take place over an extended period of time. Sales tend to increase business over the short run, but decrease business over the long run, as consumers start to avoid stores that often run sales when there isn’t a sale happening.

## Line Extension

More is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a company makes, the less money it makes. Full speed ahead in all directions just means that you’re going nowhere. Standing for everything means standing for nothing.

## Sacrifice

In order to be successful, you need to sacrifice. There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and constant change.

The target is not the market. That is, the apparent target of your marketing is not the same as the people who will actually buy your product. Even though Pepsi-Cola’s target was the teenager, the market was everybody. The 50-year-old guy who wants to think he’s 29 will drink the Pepsi.

## Attributes

Marketing is a battle of ideas. So if you are to succeed, you must have an idea or attribute of your own to focus your efforts around. Without one, you had better have a low price. A very low price. 

Burger King was unable to take the attribute of “fast” from McDonalds. However, McDonalds had another attribute: “kids”. If McDonalds owns the concept of kids, Burger King has the opportunity to market itself to the non-kids crowd, including kids who doesn’t want to be perceived as a “kid”.

## Candor

Positive thinking has been highly overrated. The explosive growth of communications in our society has made people defensive and cautious about companies trying to sell them anything. Admitting a problem is something that very few companies do.

The negative must be widely perceived as a negative. It has to trigger an instant agreement with your prospect’s mind. Next, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor isn’t to apologise. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will convince your prospect.

## Singularity

Known as the 80/20 law, the scale of outcomes are not equally distributed amounts the potential options. In the case of marketing, most often there is only one place where a competitor is vulnerable.

## Unpredictability

Instead of creating long term plans, people should aim to create short term marketing plans that follow on into long term directions. While you can’t predict the future, you can get a handle on trends, which is a way to take advantage of change.

## Success

When a brand is successful, the company assumes the name is the primary reason for the brand’s success. It’s actually the opposite. The name didn’t make the brand famous, the brand got famous because you made the right marketing moves. Marketing is too important to be delegated. It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.

## Failure

Failure is to be expected and accepted. Too many companies try to fix things rather than drop things. Admitting a mistake and not doing anything is bad, a better strategy is to recognise failure early and cut your losses.

## Hype

The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press. For the most part, hype is hype. Real revolutions don’t arrive at high noon with marching bands and coverage on the 6PM news. Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of sneak up on you.

## Acceleration

Success is not built on fads, they are built on trends. A fad is a wave in the ocean, and a trend is the tide. A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little. Forget fad. And when they appear, try to dampen them. One way to maintain a long-term demand of your product is to never totally satisfy the demand.

## Resources

Ideas without money are worthless. You have to use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help. The marketing can come later. The more successful marketers front load their investment. In other words, they take no profit for two or three years as they plow all earnings back into marketing.
