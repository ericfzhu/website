# The Law of Leadership

Create a category that you can be first in. It’s better to be first than it is to be better. It’s much easier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone you have a better product than the one that did get there first. Your product has to be at least a magnitude better than the competitors for users to want to switch.

Not every first is going to become successful, however. Timing is an issue—your first could be too early or too late.

# The Law of the Category

If you didn’t get into the prospect’s mind first, don’t give up hope. Find a new category you can be first in.

This is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented: How do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think categories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands. Everyone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open mind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what’s new. Few people are interested in what’s better.

When you’re the first in a new category, promote the category. In essence, you have no competition.

# The Law of the Mind

It’s better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first.

The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind.

That accounts for the mystery of the well-informed opinion that can almost instantly appear in a person’s mind. One day you’ve never heard of a person.. The next day that person is famous. the “overnight sensation” is not an unusual phenomenon. If you want to make a big impression on another person, you cannot worm your way into their mind and then slowly build up a favorable opinion over a period of time. The mind doesn’t work that way. You have to blast your way into the mind.

# The Law of Perception

Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perceptions. All truth is relative. Relative to your mind or the mind of another human being. When you say, “I’m right and the next person is wrong,” all you’re really saying is that you’re a better perceiver than someone else. Most people think that they are better perceivers than others. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two.

Each of us (manufacturer, distributor, dealer, prospect, customer) looks at the world through a pair of eyes. If there is objective truth out there, how would we know it? Who would measure it? Who would tell us? It could only be another person looking at the same scene through a different pair of eye-windows. Truth is nothing more or less than one expert’s perception. And who is the expert? It’s someone who is perceived to be an expert in the mind of somebody else.

You believe what you want to believe. You taste what you want to taste. Soft-drink marketing is a battle of perceptions, not a battle of a taste.

# The Law of Focus

The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind. A company can become incredibly successful if it can find a way to own a word in the mind of the prospect. Not a complicated word. Not an invented one. The simple words are best, words taken right out of the dictionary.

If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category. No one else can have a lock on it. Words come in different varieties. They can be benefit related (cavity prevention), service related (home delivery), audience related (younger people), or sales related (preferred brand).

You can’t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn’t have proponents for the opposite point of view. You can’t position yourself as an honest politician, because nobody is willing to take the opposite position. You can, however, position yourself as the pro-business candidate or the pro-labor candidate and be instantly accepted as such because there is support for the other side.

# The Law of Exclusivity

Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind. This is often the mistake companies make when they conduct focus groups, surveys, and the like. They think that spending enough money in marketing will allow you to own the word. That is only up to the other company to forfeit.

# The Law of the Ladder

Your marketing strategy should depend on how soon you got into the mind and consequently which rung of the ladder you occupy. The higher the better, of course.

The mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which information to accept and which information to reject. In general, a mind accepts only new data that is consistent with its product ladder in that category. Everything else is ignored.

What about your product’s ladder in the prospect’s mind? How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product. Everyday products (cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders. Infrequent purchase products (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders. Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently. Products that are purchased infrequently and involve an unpleasant experience usually have very few rungs on their ladders (automobile batteries, tires, and life insurance).

There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. you tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.

Sometimes your own ladder or category is too small. it might be better to be a small fish in a big pond than to be a big fish in a small pond.

# The Law of Duality

In the long run, marketing is a two-game race. Time frames, however, can vary. The fast-moving video game market played itself out in two or three seasons. The long-distance telephone market might take two or three decades. Knowing that marketing is a two-horse race in the long run can help you plan strategy in the short run.

It often happens that there is no clear-cut #2.

# The Law of the Opposite

In strength there is weakness. Wherever the leader is strong, there is an opportunity for a would-be #2 to turn the tables. There are always individuals who refuse to buy from the leader of a product category.

# The Law of Division

Over time, a category will divide and become two or more categories. Each segment is a separate, distinct entity. Each segment has its own reason for existence. Each segment has its own leader, which is rarely the same leader as the original category.

Many corporate leaders hold the naïve belief that categories are combining. Synergy and its kissing cousin the corporate alliance are the buzzwords in the boardrooms of America. It won’t happen. Categories are dividing, not combining.

The way for the leader to maintain its dominance is to address each emerging category with a different brand name, as General Motors did in the early days with Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.

What keeps leaders from launching a different brand to cover a new category is the fear of what will happen to their existing brands. GM was slow to react to the super premium category that Mercedes and BMW established. One reason was that a new brand on top of Cadillac would enrage GM’s Cadillac dealers.

GM tried to take Cadillac up-market and it bombed. Why would anyone spend $54k on a Cadillac when their neighbors would probably think they only paid $30k? No prestige.

Timing is also important. You can be too early to exploit a new category. Back in the fifties the Nash Rambler was America’s first small car. But American Motors didn’t have either the courage or the money to hang in there long enough for the category to develop.

# The Law of Perspective

Marketing efforts take place over an extended period of time. Sales tend to increase business over the short run, but decrease business over the long run. This is because consumers start to understand that regular prices are too high and avoid stores that often run sales when there isn’t a sale happening. Any sort of couponing, discounts or sales tend to educate consumers to buy only when they can get a deal.

# The Law of Line Extension

The irresistible pressure to extend the equity of the brand. Line extension is a process that occurs with almost no conscious effort on the part of the corporation. It’s like a closet or a desk drawer that fills up with almost no effort on your part. Line extension involves taking the brand name of a successful product and putting it on a new product. But marketing is a battle of perception, not product. 

More is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a company makes, the less money it makes. Full speed ahead in all directions just means that you’re going nowhere. Standing for everything means standing for nothing.

# The Law of Sacrifice

You have to give up something in order to get something. The law of sacrifice is the opposite of the law of extension. In order to be successful, you need to sacrifice. There are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and constant change.

The target is not the market. That is, the apparent target of your marketing is not the same as the people who will actually buy your product. Even though Pepsi-Cola’s target was the teenager, the market was everybody. The 50-year-old guy who wants to think he’s 29 will drink the Pepsi.

It’s about selling consumers a vision that they can indulge in.

# The Law of Attributes

For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute. Marketing is a battle of ideas. So if you are to succeed, you must have an idea or attribute of your own to focus your efforts around. Without one, you had better have a low price. A very low price. Some attributes are more important to customers than others.

Burger King was unable to take the attribute of “fast” from McDonalds. However, McDonalds had another attribute: “kids”. If McDonalds owns the concept of kids, Burger King has the opportunity to market itself to the non-kids crowd, including kids who doesn’t want to be perceived as a “kid”.

In order to make the concept work, Burger King would have to invoke the law of sacrifice and give the “kids” concept to McDonalds. 

# The Law of Candor

One of the most effective ways to get into a prospect’s mind is to first admit a negative and then twist it into a positive. Positive thinking has been highly overrated. The explosive growth of communications in our society has made people defensive and cautious about companies trying to sell them anything. Admitting a problem is something that very few companies do.

The law of candor must be used carefully and with great skill. The negative must be widely perceived as a negative. It has to trigger an instant agreement with your prospect’s mind. Next, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor isn’t to apologise. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will convince your prospect.

# The Law of Singularity

Also known as the power law or the 80/20 law, the scale of outcomes are not equally distributed amounts the potential options. In the case of marketing, most often there is only one place where a competitor is vulnerable.

# The Law of Unpredictability

Instead of creating long term plans, people should aim to create short term marketing plans that follow on into long term directions. While you can’t predict the future, you can get a handle on trends, which is a way to take advantage of change.

# The Law of Success

Success often leads to arrogance, and arrogance to failure. When a brand is successful, the company assumes the name is the primary reason for the brand’s success. It’s actually the opposite. The name didn’t make the brand famous, the brand got famous because you made the right marketing moves. Marketing is too important to be delegated. It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.

## The Law of Failure

Failure is to be expected and accepted. Too many companies try to fix things rather than drop things. Admitting a mistake and not doing anything is bad, a better strategy is to recognise failure early and cut your losses.

If you learn something and you’re trying something, then you probably get credit for it. But woe to the person who makes the same mistake twice.

# The Law of Hype

The situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press. For the most part, hype is hype. Real revolutions don’t arrive at high noon with marching bands and coverage on the 6PM news. Real revolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of sneak up on you.

# The Law of Acceleration

Success is not built on fads, they are built on trends. A fad is a wave in the ocean, and a trend is the tide. A fad gets a lot of hype, and a trend gets very little. Forget fad. And when they appear, try to dampen them. One way to maintain a long-term demand of your product is to never totally satisfy the demand. But the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term trend.

# The Law of Resources

Even the best idea in the world won’t go very far without the money to get it off the ground. You’ll get further with a mediocre idea and a million dollars than with a great idea alone.

Ideas without money are worthless. You have to use your idea to find the money, not the marketing help. The marketing can come later. The more successful marketers front load their investment. In other words, they take no profit for two or three years as they plow all earnings back into marketing.
