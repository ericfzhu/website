    "searching for meaning": "\"When a man can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure.\"\n\n-Viktor Frankl",
    "context switching": "Context switching is one of the most expensive actions you can make.",
    "locus of control": "There are things in life that are within your control, and the rest that are not.",

    "what the hell is water": "\"If you’re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won’t consider possibilities that aren’t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options.
