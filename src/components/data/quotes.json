        "quote": "Love is real only when a person can sacrifice himself for another person. Only when a person forgets himself for the sake of another, and lives for another creature, only this kind of love can be called true love, and only in this love do we see the blessing and reward of life. This is the foundation of the world.\n\nNothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than perpetual kindness."

        "quote": "Women are like these master artists who can turn any old place into something that feels like home.\n\nIt's not just about material things; it's something deeper. They have this knack, this hardwired thing, for beautifying space, making them more, I don't know, human. And it's not just physical spaces - they do it with situations, too, bringing this lightness, this sort of effervescence. They're always putting others first, which is both incredible and kind of heartbreaking, because they often sideline themselves in the process. And there's this vulnerability they have; it sort of nudges men to be better, to strive more, which is a weird but real dynamic.\n\nSo, really, what's there not to love about women? Women are this gift, man, they kinda make all the rough stuff in life seem less rough. Beauty, in all of its forms, is like an antidote to the ugliness of the world, and a well-loved woman? She's the epitome of that. Women are this light in the deepest dark, this calm in the relentless storm. Without them, what's life even about? What's left to strive for, really?"

        "quote": "Passive, submissive imitation does exist, but hatred of conformity and extreme individualism are no less imitative. Today they constitute a negative conformism that is more formidable than the positive version. More and more, it seems to me, modern individualism assumes the form of a desperate denial of the fact that, through mimetic desire, each of us seeks to impose his will upon his fellow man, whom he professes to love but more often despises."

For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. \n\nA lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. \n\nPut yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. It's gonna take awhile. It's normal to take awhile. You've just gotta fight your way through."

But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down."

Money is not wealth. It's just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. \n\nYou can make more wealth.\n\nWealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history."
